## Managed RAG options on AWS
To manage Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows on AWS, you can choose between custom RAG pipelines or fully managed AWS services is a kind of options. While fully managed services streamline operations by handling much of the undifferentiated heavy lifting with their core components, they provide fewer opportunities for customization.
As stated in the [AWS Prescriptive Guidance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/retrieval-augmented-generation-options/introduction.html), the following managed options are currently available on AWS:
- Knowledge bases for Amazon Bedrock
- Amazon Q Business
- Amazon SageMaker Canvas

According to AWS, Amazon Q Business is the top recommended choice for a fully managed RAG solution. However, you should consider alternative options if your requirements fall into one of the following scenarios:
- The service is unavailable in your AWS region, and moving data to a supported region is not feasible.
- Your RAG workflow requires customization beyond the standard capabilities of Amazon Q Business.
- You need to use an existing vector database or integrate a specific LLM.  

## :hammer_and_wrench: Getting started
